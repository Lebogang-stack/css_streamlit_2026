    ### 📘 Motivation Behind the App

    This application is motivated by **Chapters 4 and 5** of my Honours research study, 
    which focused on the **statistical analysis of the onset of depression among university students**.

    The app is designed to translate statistical insights into a **simple, non-diagnostic tool** 
    that promotes **early awareness, self-reflection, and proactive support-seeking** among students.
